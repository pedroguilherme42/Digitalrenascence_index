    <p>
        I'm facing these demons on my own not facing real
        I’m facing  these shivers on my home not getting it
        I’m dealing with stress from inside out trying to see the brightside
        I'm facing these demons on my own not facing real
        I’m facing  these shivers on my home not getting it
        I’m dealing with stress from inside out trying to see the brightside
        
        Alright let’s see, testing
        I think my stepmother is about to arrive
        So you just, you know...
        
        Merged into my own despair 
        I'm amused but fucking scared 
        Upside down a crucifix  
        I make memories in a blink 
        
        I’m amused power la-la-la-like gunpowder
        I’mma blow this shit 
        Cornea red with the flattered bliss 
        
        Head is drowning in the bed 
        I’m amused but fucking scared 
        
        Lost angels falling in the deep
        I’m their devil (fuck)
        Inside anomaly (anomaly)
        Yea, brief extasis followed by melancholy (call me, call me, call me, call me)
        
        Like 666 I'm guided by the street lights trying to face real life
        Brief extasis followed by melancholy (call me, call me, call me, call me) 
        
        My control has been wielded for the flaming sea (Fuck) 
        I’m falling deep 
        I’d rather quit this shit than to stay clean  
        I’m on my knees
        Novocaine 
        
        Fucking plane dude
        Alright wait up  
        
        (this is an emergency broadcast from the BBC) 
        
        Cash it in (yeah)
        Cash it out (yeah)
        Cash it in (yeah)
        Cash it out (yeah)
        
        Spilling boose right from my mouth  
        Worshiping the ancient vowels 
        
        I see it now, bread and wine and a virgin corpse’s bride
        I'm killing time with the devil in desguise  
        Fireflies right out my eyes 
        
        Merged into my own despair
        I'm amused but fucking scared 
        (call me, call me, call me, call me) (fuck)
        Upside down a crucifix
        I make memories in a blink 
        (call me, call me, call me, call me)
        
        I’m amused power la-la-la-like gunpowder
        (call me, call me, call me, call me) (fuck)
        I’mma blow this shit 
        Cornea red with the flattered bliss
        (call me, call me, call me, call me)
        
        Head is drowning in the bed 
        I’m amused but fucking scared</p>

<p>Press esc, stretch latex on my chest
    Princess seize me like you do, you do the rest
    Adressed the issue it’s not my intent to stay dense
    In the no man’s land I have no chains bitch 
    Get back get back motherfucker gonna break your neck
    Princess seize me like you do, you do the rest
    Adressed the issue it’s not my intent to stay dense
    
    Backpack with a drag it’s killing me with dread
    White gold on the table it looks like a fable
    Black deck redneck, red Winston on the checks
    In the  no man’s land i have no chains 
    My gospel is sinner take it up your widow floating through my aura
     while you Looking all rushed i’m floating in the stars with a fucking kush 
    bars
    tied into strings like industry plants 
    keth be hanging in the fence
    he cut up my wings was na angel now i sing 
    bitch 
    
    press esc from desire my lungs are like on fire 
    can’t decide my facts i look in the mirror someone else blink back 
    seeing life in a notification bar is it better than seeing through a desktop 
    flying like a calendar 
    i did it again i’m losing my senses 
    blurred all out like aa instagram filter i’m just in schock
    how did life became this fucked?
    Switch back When it gets real harsh proxy grotesque is just the start 
    21th century all the lights are fucking gone 
    Press esc, just close the tab
    </p>

    <p>Carmen’s dead in the death bed drinks spilling with a wine breath
        Blossom from the summer’s wrath
        Carmen’s lagged frask make you feel less in the fate of despair
        You are now aware there’s no turning back 
        Chilling with the breeze of it’s breath it came to me but i’m not set 
        Taking this shit off my chest so I can finally rest
        
        Crisis crisis in the 20’s I was hired for a job 
        But fired from Only fans keth be hanging in the fence
        Stay the fuck away from me i’m tring to quit 
        Blunt roll blast flow skies are red and now in flames
        
        Skies are red and now in flames i’m bleeding chrome again 
        Bleeding bleeding bleeding chrome again
        In the avenue you come alike dreaded asymtomathic Youth they might be confused like a jack in the box 
        
        Carmen’s dead in the deathbed glass pool liver upset 
        All the red flags that i pass i just press reset i fill back all the void with a frask of whisky i’m fucking busy cracking my crackhead heart to write these lyrics i.c.u guy do you fucking feel me?
        Carmen’s spirit halfway through the ceiling can’t conceil it 
        The weight of sins and the violent screaming
